# tortura-htmlGame

Just some context: I made this game in my final year of highschool, with barebones javascript. In the future maybe I refactorate this a little, but I learnt a lot writing this. Spriteframes, collision, times, input, audio, even some "shader" fun.
To run this, just open the html file on Chrome or Firefox. Have fun! And pause with 'P' to read the instructions on the page.
